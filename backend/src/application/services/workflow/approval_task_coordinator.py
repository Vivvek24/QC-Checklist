"""
Approval task coordinator.

This is the join between the two halves of the engine. The state machine says
*what* moves are legal; the approval matrix says *who* should be asked. This
coordinator is the only thing that reads both, turning a transition into concrete
tasks and deciding when the chain moves on.

The rules, driven entirely by the transition's declared `action_type`:

    SUBMIT      open level 1 of the matching matrix
    APPROVE     settle this level; open the next one, or finish the chain
    REJECT      settle this level; abandon the chain
    CANCEL      abandon the chain
    REFER_BACK  settle this level; abandon the chain so a later SUBMIT restarts
                it from level 1
    others      leave the chain alone

Two semantics worth being explicit about, because neither is the only defensible
choice:

1. A role-based level fans out to every eligible holder of the role, and the
   first one to act settles it. The peers' tasks are cancelled rather than
   deleted, so the record still shows who was asked.
2. Which matrix routes an instance is decided once, when the chain opens, and
   remembered on the tasks. Editing a matrix mid-flight does not re-route work
   already in someone's queue.
