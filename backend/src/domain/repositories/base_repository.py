"""
Base repository interface - defines common CRUD contract.

Shared by code-keyed reference (master) aggregates. Entity-specific ports
extend this and may add optional filter arguments to `list_all` / `count`,
plus their own query methods.

Aggregates that are not code-keyed (`User`, `RoleAssignment`, `Permission`,
`AuditLog`, `LdapConfig`, `DarwinboxEmployee` — keyed on `employee_id`) declare
a standalone `ABC` instead; see `api-layer-standard.md`. Do not force those onto
this contract just for consistency.
