"""
File logging configuration with rotating handler and gzip compression.
Writes to log file ONLY — does not add another console handler.

The destination comes from `settings.log_file`, which roots a relative
LOG_FILE_PATH under UPLOAD_DIR so log files are written to the configured
storage mount rather than the process working directory.
