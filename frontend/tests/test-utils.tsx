/**
 * Shared render helper for component/hook tests.
 *
 * Mirrors the real provider stack from `App.tsx` (Redux `Provider` →
 * `QueryClientProvider` → `PrimeReactProvider`), plus a `MemoryRouter` so
 * components that call `useNavigate`/`useLocation`/`<Navigate>` (the route
 * guards, mainly) do not throw for lacking a router context. Wrapping
 * router-agnostic components in it too is harmless — nothing reads the
 * router unless a component actually asks for it.
 *
 * A fresh `QueryClient` per render is deliberate: TanStack Query caches by
 * key, so reusing one client across tests would let an earlier test's cached
 * response leak into a later test that never mocked it.

// Side-effect import, kept first and unused by name: `@app/store` sits at the
// top of a real (if harmless) circular-import cycle with `@core/rbac`'s
// barrel — that barrel's `usePermissions.ts` imports `@app/store` for its
// hooks, and `@app/store` itself imports `rbacReducer` back from the same
// barrel. The real app never notices because `App.tsx` always reaches
// `@app/store` first, before anything needs a fully-built reducer map. This
// module instead imports `rbacReducer` directly from the barrel as its first
// real import, which can resolve the cycle in the opposite order and leaves
// `@app/store`'s own (otherwise-unused-here) singleton assembled with a
// still-undefined `rbacReducer`, logging Redux's "No reducer provided for
// key rbac" warning. Importing `@app/store` first, exactly like `App.tsx`
// does, forces the same safe resolution order.
