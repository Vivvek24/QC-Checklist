/**
 * Helper for building a parent-picker lookup.
 *
 * Two lists rather than one, on purpose: a picker must only offer *active*
 * parents, because pointing a new rule at a retired legislation is never
 * intended. But existing rows keep whatever parent they were given, so resolving
 * a stored id needs the *unfiltered* list — otherwise a record whose parent was
 * later deactivated would render as a bare UUID.
