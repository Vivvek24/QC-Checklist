/**
 * Active/Inactive tag for master records.
 *
 * Masters are retired via `is_active` rather than deleted, so this column is the
 * usual way a row is taken out of use. Severity follows the standard's mapping:
 * active is success, inactive is a warning rather than an error — a deactivated
 * country is intentional, not a fault.
